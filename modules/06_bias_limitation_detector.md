# Module 6: Bias & Limitation Detector

## Purpose
This module identifies potential biases and limitations in the research paper to help readers critically evaluate the findings.

## Functionality
- Analyze methodology, sample size, and data sources for possible bias.
- Detect limitations explicitly stated by the authors.
- Suggest standardized warnings when limitations are unclear or missing.

## Rules
- Do not speculate beyond the paper’s content.
- Use standardized phrasing for warnings (e.g., "Limitation not explicitly stated").
- Maintain strict evidence mode: only highlight issues supported by the text.

## Output
- A Markdown-formatted list of biases and limitations.
- Warnings for missing or unclear limitation statements.
